/// <summary>
/// Whole-combat history counters that some cards read through <c>CalculatedVarSpecRegistry</c> and that the
/// state key otherwise does not see.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The state key covers piles, powers, RNG streams and the per-turn counters kept on
/// <see cref="SimulatedCombatState"/>, but not how many card plays, draws, channels or hits the whole fight has
/// accumulated. Gold Axe's damage is the number of finished card plays in the combat; Voltaic, Tear Asunder,
/// Pull From Below, Murder and Supermassive read similar totals. Two branches that reach the same piles and
/// resources through a different number of plays therefore hash to the same key while those cards would deal
/// different damage, and exact dedup keeps only one of them. A shadow trace over 50 offline roots found six such
/// same-key/different-output pairs, all on Gold Axe (19 versus 18 finished plays).
///
/// The counters are appended only when the root deck holds one of those cards, so every other fight keeps its
/// key, its transposition hits and its dedup exactly as before. The live history before the root is constant
/// for the whole request and is left out; only the simulated part can differ between branches.
